Apesar das inúmeras vantagens que esse processo oferece aos usuários, boa parte dessas interfaces apresenta problemas de desempenho, em geral ligados ao uso assistemático dos recursos expressivos na linguagem de interação. Nesses sistemas essa questão é particularmente importante, em função de sua complexidade e das restrições expressivas impostas pelo recurso visual. Sistemas de Modelagem Geométrica são sistemas de representação/abstração de objetos do mundo físico no mundo computacional, logo, são sistemas de natureza intrinsecamente semiótica. Sendo sistemas criadores de signos, eles devem apoiar os usuários nas ações fundamentais relativas a essa tarefa, como: selecionar e instituir formas significativas, e prover mecanismos sistemáticos para a interpretação de tais formas quando usadas em atos de comunicação/representação. Este trabalho trata sobre linguagens visuais por manipulação direta para Sistemas de Modelagem Geométrica.

Nós sugerimos que se estes consultores fossem treinados para o teste de avaliação heurística eles poderiam aumentar a quantidade e melhorar a qualidade das suas sugestões nos projetos. Para comprovar esta hipótese, um conjunto de três experimentos foi conduzido: teste com usuários, avaliação heurística com especialistas em interface, e avaliação heurística com especialistas em um domínio de conhecimento treinados previamente para o teste. Os problemas identificados nos experimentos foram comparados com os previamente encontrados pela equipe multidisciplinar (projetistas e consultores) sem a utilização de técnicas de usabilidade. Os resultados indicaram um aumento quantitativo e qualitativo de informações sobre usabilidade quando os especialista em um domínio de conhecimento são treinados para o testes de avaliação heurística. Observou-se também que cada teste cobre porções distintas de problemas de usabilidade com a interface, e devem ser utilizados em conjunto para uma avaliação mais eficiente.",,

Desta forma, também podem ser utilizados para ajudar os usuários a atingir dois objetivos: compreender os modelos subjacentes do domínio e da aplicação, se os mecanismos forem combinados com explicações; e obter uma forma mais eficiente de comunicação, com refinamentos retóricos, como destacar alguns aspectos de objetos e não outros.","This  article  addresses  extensible  applications  from  acommunicative  perspective.

They say they will put affordances in the interface, or afford this or that to the users, but Norman points out that affordances only exist inasmuch as they are perceived by users. Therefore, it doesn?t make sense to use the term as designers do. This paper takes the designers? phrases as a spontaneous expression of design intent and explores the correspondences between these and two of the phenomena captured by communicability evaluation: missing and declining affordances. It highlights some useful distinctions between levels of affordances, and hints at possible links between communicative and cognitive perspectives. It suggests that framing affordances within a broader communicative dimension, and taking advantage of the rhetoric that people use to describe what they are doing, can bring interesting insights to design.",

Vozze integrates three major concepts: multitactile surfaces, speech recognition, and workspaces that are dynamically created and linked to each other. Our main goal is to provide the advantages of using a technological platform in innovation processes while maintaining a natural interaction. Multi-tactile surfaces are based on simple hand gestures we have designed. Speech recognition addresses issues related with text entry on interactive surfaces, which typically relies on cumbersome virtual keyboards. Finally, dynamic workspaces allow users to easily represent and share their ideas, as well as to create associations among them. We describe a prototypical implementation of Vozze as well as results from initial usability and user experience evaluations.",

193,4699,2011,Multidirectional Knowledge Extraction Process for Creating Behavioral Personas,EN,4,,,,,,"The consideration of user aspects in the design of computer systems is vital to maintaining the quality of these products. The search for user information as to their interests, needs, and behaviors, requires actions that can be costly. However, the use of such information in an inefficient, inaccurate manner, without the formation of knowledge discourages the process of user-centered development. Interface designers need to collect information and consume it efficiently. One option for documenting and efficiently consuming the information from user research is to apply the technique of personas. The extraction of knowledge in databases is the selection and processing of data with the purpose of identifying new patterns, provide greater accuracy on known patterns, and model the real world. Thus, this work presents a multidirectional process of extracting knowledge for creating behavioral personas. The processes of data mining are performed and compared with variations allowing a real knowledge extraction in the creation of personas. The process is multidirectional being able to be applied in both directions for the composition of any kind of personas.

Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems have been used to help designers deal with a large repertoire of past design cases in many domains, like architecture and software. However, we still have little work that addresses Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design in CBR systems. In general, they focus on specific HCI design artifacts, considering just a few aspects of HCI solutions. In this paper, we review related works to propose an enlarged conceptual model for HCI design cases in CBR systems. The model is flexible and extensible to accommodate different design artifacts, supporting different design processes and cultures. We have evaluated our conceptual model with a qualitative research, in which participants were asked to index and retrieve cases during an HCI design activity, referring to characteristics of context of use, domain, user, user goal, interaction, user interface, and system. The results indicate that CBR systems for HCI design should consider a wide view of the HCI problem and solution spaces, and the proposed conceptual model has great potential to support designers in dealing with a large repertoire of HCI design cases in CBR systems.",

Modos de se considerar as emoções no design destes sistemas têm sido discutidos. A literatura, inclusive, apresenta formas de se avaliar a resposta emocional dos usuários. Mais do que a avaliação das emoções, a associação de emoções com decisões de design pode apoiar o trabalho dos designers de sistemas interativos. Este artigo apresenta uma proposta de associação de respostas emocionais humanas a elementos de interface. A proposta é pautada pela identificação de emoções por meio das 10 heurísticas de Lera e Domingo [11] e da Estrutura do Espaço Emocional Semântico de Scherer [19]. Um estudo de viabilidade da proposta foi realizado, consistindo na observação da interação de idosos com um website sobre culinária por meio de tablets. Os resultados permitem uma avaliação de como decisões de design podem afetar a interação ? por exemplo, como decisões ruins podem comprometer o domínio do usuário sobre a interação.",,

AgentSheets is a visual programming environment to build games. Based on previous studies showing that semiotic relations among visual game elements could be further explored to the benefit of the learners, we designed PoliFacets, a Web extension to AgentSheets cast as a live conversational document. With it, teachers and learners can follow different threads of conversation about (multiple representations of) game elements and relations between them. We present a qualitative evaluation study of PoliFacets with two experienced AgentSheets instructors and three school teachers trained to coach students in CTA programs. Findings show that although our system has not yet completely fulfilled our design intent, it has led participants to gain relevant insights about their teaching and learning, as well as to articulating doubts and misunderstandings that otherwise could have gone unnoticed.",

Interaction design is a new field of design that poses challenges for sketching, due to particular characteristics of the field such as being dynamic and “immaterial”. In this study we focus on screen-based interactions, and particularly on rich interactions. To overcome these challenges one approach that has not been much explored is trying to improve sketches of interaction done on paper. With this in mind we propose ActionSketch, a technique that tries to accomplish this and is composed of four parts: frames, colors, symbols and rules. To validate the technique we conducted four workshops with 24 professionals, followed by a period of continued use of approximately three weeks. Our findings confirmed the need for better representations of interactions on sketches, offered insights into the benefits of using the proposed technique and indicated some opportunities for improvement. One major point for discussion is how the technique extends the current practice of sketching, and how it benefits from doing so.",

The system explores a visualization ontology to offer a set of graphs that help to answer information-based questions related to the current graph data. By traversing the recommended graphs through their related questions, the user implicitly acquires knowledge both on the domain and on visualization resources that better represent the domain concepts of interest. This paper also reports a qualitative study conducted to evaluate ViSC, using two methods: the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) and a Retrospective Communicability Evaluation (RCE) —a combination of the Communicability Evaluation Method (CEM) and Retrospective Think Aloud Protocol.

ao design com a MoLICC. ","Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) denotes a class of systems with which users interact to cooperate, coordinate and communicate with one another. New challenges led various research fields to study CSCW, especially interaction design. In order to support the interaction design of collaboration based on Semiotic Engineering at a tactical level, an extension to the MoLIC (Modelling Language for Interaction as Conversation) language was proposed, allowing designers to consider the influences between users, cooperative tasks and awareness mechanisms. The extended language is called MoLICC. In this work, we present an analysis of MoLICC using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations (CDN) framework, which allowed us to find limitations in the language. Results point to possible improvements to the language and features for a tool to support interaction design using
MoLICC.",

However, their use is generally restricted to the original purpose of informal communication without taking advantage of their potential to promote interaction in formal settings. In this paper, we investigate the design and use of mobile applications in formal communication processes, exploring meaning evolution of WhatsApp use in a real context. We propose a system to enable students to conduct preparatory pre-class activities using WhatsApp with text commands and multimedia messages. Our analysis of the system use suggests that it is feasible to appropriate mobile communication applications with which students are already familiar for the use in formal

If such considerations are not made properly, the desired goals by the developer cannot be obtained. In other words, one needs to understand the relationship between the developer’s goals, the game mechanics and the profile of users (players).

In this context, we conducted an eye tracking study with 12 target users to analyze how scale inversion (area proportional to 1/value) can support the identification of elements with small values represented in treemaps. Results show that when the inverted scale supports the task, users are able to identify elements individually and in a less ambiguous way, but took more time to interpret the inverted scale treemap. With the presented results, we expect that Human-Computer Interaction practitioners working on space-filling visualizations to include interactive scales to invert the visualizations scale when the task at hand involves evaluating minimum and/or maximum values.",

For people with severe motor disabilities, gaze is one of the few alternatives to interact with the world. The most common gaze interaction paradigm is called dwell-time, where keys are selected using fixations longer than a certain “dwell”. Though simple, this mechanism does not permit the selection of keys at precise moments, a requirement to play music and certain video games. In this paper we introduce two gaze interaction techniques that overcome this limitation. The first is an extension of the dwell-time, where selection is triggered when the gaze exits the focused key. The second is based on the Context Switching paradigm, that uses saccades for selection instead offixations. Results of a user experiment show that the Context Switching paradigm permits a more accurate timing control while playing music at 45 and 70 beats per minute.",

Usually, searches are submitted based on few terms and the results are dozens of links listed through several pages. Different criteria are used by the search engines to establish the order in which the links appear in this list. Often, the user has to browse the list until finding the relevant information. This scenario increases the need of alternative forms of displaying search results. Although internet services become more attractive when providing information through graphical representations, surprisingly very few initiatives have been devoted to the practical use of visual representations of search results. The present work addresses this issue by presenting a study about the experience and satisfaction of subjects when using two web search tools which display their results graphically. This study is a step towards the identification of requirements for visual tools",
342,4857,2006,Applying common sense to distance learning: the case of home care education,,7,,,,,,"One of the challenges of Distance Learning (DL) over the Web is that it imposes physical distance between teachers and students, and thus reduces opportunities for teachers to fully understand the state of student knowledge and adapt instructional material to their needs. While the knowledge to be taught is usually well expressed in the curriculum material, the knowledge of a typical student is harder to codify. In this paper, it is shown how a large knowledge base of common sense statements can be used to help model student knowledge and consequently to help teachers plan learning actions by • Identifying topics that need coverage by the curriculum; • Identifying what a student is already likely to know; • Locating possible misconceptions that need to be corrected; and • Assuring that the student understands the vocabulary needed to express relevant subject material.",

626,5141,2016,"The Tyrants, Heroes and Victims Narrative in Accessibility Tracks Papers of the Brazilian Symposium on Human Factors in Computer Systems",,2,,,,,,"Previous studies indicated that some practices in the Interaction Design-related technical communication advocate considering users as victims unable to solve their own problems and bestowing a paternal role to the designer. These practices sometimes occur in User-Centered Design (UCD) literature, offering a risk of compromising the focus on the user proposed by the UCD theories, by unempowering the users and removing them from the productive process. This paper proposes a method for analysing content of papers on accessibility-related tracks of the latest editions of the Brazillian Symposium on Human Factors in Computer Systems to investigate whether the appropriations of UCD in the publications are unempowering users through a narrative trope called ""Tyrants, Heroes and Victims"", defined by Clay Spinuzzi, or empowering narratives are employed in writing. We expect that this paper will serve as an exposition of the usage, and the risks, of unempowering narratives in the Interaction Design community.",

This article presents an investigation, as a part of a major research, based on 14 studies, about use of psychophysiological measures in HCI research. We found 1) that psychophysiological measures are still difficult to apply, once sensors are still invasive and difficult to understand and use; 2) each psychophysiological measure represents various emotions, and each emotion is measured by various psychophysiological measures; and 3) it is necessary to explore and discover more solutions to user's emotion measurement. This scenario shows an opportunity for UX evaluation methods, once a future work considers the use of psychophysiological measures.",
633,5148,2016,Communicability evaluation in systems created by designer-users,,2,,,,,,"The number of people who strive to build their own systems grows every day, and for this type of activity we use the expression End-User Development (EUD). Communicability defines whether a system can make the user understands what the designer wanted to communicate when building a system. In this work, we evaluated the communicability in systems built by end users. For this evaluation, we used two methods: the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) and the Communicability Evaluation Method (CEM). Through these methods, we evaluated systems built by volunteers in a tool called SideTalk, which helps people with little or no programming knowledge to create conversations. We also evaluated the visualization of these conversations by other volunteers. We found a series of breakdowns in communication, either from the conversations or from the system itself. The main contribution of this paper is to present an innovative research in the area EUD which uses two methods of semiotics engineering, SIM and CEM, to evaluate the communicability of non-professional systems.",

648,5163,2016,Analysis of Configuration Decision Space Over Time: The Google Inactive Manager Account Case,,3,,,,,,"Some configuration settings have immediate impact on system state; others have impact over time. In group systems, the timeline of impacts can be even more complex, because changes may impact not only the user who made them but also other users. When a system is designed, its designers plan what configuration settings to provide users with, as well as how these settings will affect the system and when. They must also help users anticipate how these settings impact the available interactive paths over time, so that users can make informed decisions about their settings. In this paper we show how two analytical tools -- the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) and the Configurable Interaction Anticipation Challenges (CIAC) -- can be combined to probe the complexity of decisions that users may take in during a configuration task.

672,5187,2016,Recommendations for Usability Testing in Ubiquitous Applications,,3,,,,,,"Ubiquitous systems change the way users interact with computers, because their services must be available anytime and everywhere, supporting users in several everyday activities. Thus, there is a high risk of users feeling annoyed and overwhelmed by ubiquitous systems. It is, therefore, essential to evaluate the quality of use in those systems. One of the methods to perform this activity is the usability testing. However, the traditional process does not take into account specific characteristics from ubiquitous systems, for example context-awareness, transparency, attention, calmness, and mobility. This paper provides eight recommendations for usability testing in ubiquitous applications based on a literature review and on the authors experience with the evaluation of those systems.",
673,5188,2016,An approach for the simulation of flexible ubiquitous environments,,3,,,,,,"Intelligent environments, as houses and cities, will only reach their main objective when addressing the users' different needs. However, consider the several different human factors, and also the ubiquitous technologies specificities, in the design process is still a challenge. It is known that many researchers use simulation techniques to smooth the process of ubiquitous systems design and evaluation. However, many of these simulation techniques have failed to cover the different users' needs and support the development of flexible user interfaces. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an approach to simulate flexible ubiquitous environments that consider the diversity of users. This new approach was developed from the adaptation of the Wizard of Oz technique. This paper also describes the application of this approach in a simulation of a smart kitchen.",

683,5198,2017,Modeling Task Deviations as Eccentricity Distribution Peaks,,3,,,,,,"Detailed usage data is becoming available through different devices (e.g., personal computer, cell phones, tablets, watches, glasses, wrist bands), in huge volumes, and in a speed that requires new models and visualizations to support the understanding of detailed user actions at scale. Without appropriate methods that summarize or provide means of analyzing large usage data sets, a semantic gap between the event-by-event data and the tasks profile remains. In this context, this work proposes a technique to support the analysis of task deviation from the examination of detailed user interface events streams. From the analysis of 427 event-by-event logged sessions (captured under user consent) of a technical reference website, this work presents how to identify task deviations by using eccentricity distribution. The proposed technique is a promising way of identifying task deviations in large log data sets containing information about how users performed real tasks.",

686,5201,2017,A Conceptual Framework to design Users Digital Legacy Management Systems,,2,,,,,,"Current computer systems facilitate interaction between users for various purposes, including the management of their Digital Legacy. The Digital Legacy of a user is formed by several items and virtual possessions that have some type of value (e.g., financial, affective or of another nature) to someone, for the individual himself/herslef or other stakeholders. Systems that aim to support the management of users' digital legacy cover a series of configurations with long-term effects, as well as implementing different ways of handling temporality of information and organizing the roles users can take. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to support the designers of Digital Legacy Management Systems (DLMS), by describing the dimensions that are relevant to these systems and the values they can take. The framework was proposed based on a systematic analysis of 6 Digital Legacy Management Systems, using the Semiotic Inspection Method in combination with the Interaction Anticipation Design Challenges. The preliminary evaluation of our framework yielded initial positive indicators about its use in the design of a DLMS prototype.",
687,5202,2017,Writing Towards Promoting the Empowerment of Persons With Disabilities in Digital Inclusion Texts,,3,,,,,,"Writing technical texts that promote the empowerment of persons with disabilities is an important step towards the social inclusion of persons with diverse needs and conditions. However, few Computer Science events and journals present guidelines for writing about them - even those whose topics of interest involve persons with disabilities - and those that present guidelines often are limited to the adjustment of terminology or digital document accessibility. We review current and emergent practices of writing technical texts about digital accessibility and inclusion of persons who use accessibility resources, and we propose means to direct technical communication towards the promotion of empowerment when writing about persons with disabilities, reviewing not only terminology and document accessibility, but also approaches, and concepts, for user involvement, as well as the creation of narratives that are aware of the users' personal power. We expect this paper to provide directions for technical communicators on writing texts that are more aligned with the fact that each person has power to make a change on their own lives, and that artifacts can be used as means for furthering these choices and enabling persons towards their own objectives.",

The goal of the study presented in this paper was to analyze the adequacy of interface components to implement mobile applications, in order to identify the main accessibility problems that could be encountered by developers when using them, and the main strategies to overcome those issues. We performed an accessibility evaluation of a sample of 30 Android interface components present in 3 prototypes of mobile applications, employing the development techniques of native applications with and withoug Web components and hybrid development using the Apache Cordova framework. The results showed that the prototypes developed using web components were more compatible with accessibility criteria in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) and with the screen reader Talkback. The most frequent accessibility problems in such components occurred in tables, headings and multimedia elements. Based on the current challenges for accessibility in mobile applications, we highlight the limitations of some interface components and emphasize that more studies need to be carried out to consolidate accessibility guidelines and good practices for mobile devices.",
690,5205,2017,A Systematic Mapping Study on Research Contributions on UX Evaluation Technologies,,2,,,,,,"User eXperience (UX) refers to quality attributes related to the feelings and emotions of the users. In order to evaluate UX, several technologies (tools, methods, techniques, others) have been proposed that range from using questionnaires to employing biometrics. However, it is essential to characterize UX evaluation technologies to obtain evidence on the contexts in which using a specific technology can provide better evaluation results. In this paper, we present the state of the art on how to evaluate the UX of software applications. We performed a systematic mapping study with an initial sample of 2101 papers from which 227 relevant papers describing UX evaluation technologies have been identified. The results suggest that there is a need for specific UX evaluation technologies that are easy and comfortable to use from the point of view of users, while supporting practitioners in the correction of the aspects that cause poor experiences.",
691,5206,2017,Bottlenecks Identification in Software Development Process: A Quali-Quantitative Approach,,4,,,,,,"This paper presents the quali-quantitative results of a study on the identification of bottlenecks in the software development process. The research was developed in an environment learning of Software Engineering and had the collaboration of students of the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The main objective of the research is to verify the existence of productive bottlenecks in Software Development Process (SDP), typify them and if possible to promote treatments to solve the impacts in the process and in the software product. For this, three experimental rounds were carried out and three different domains were applied. Each round had deferential teams working in the same domain. The experiments also involved the Unified Process (UP) to guiding the SDP and the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to identify and treat the restrictive elements found in the productive process. As results, the work presents a set of qualitative constraints subdivided into two groups: (1) Behavioral Constraints (BC), and (2) Technical Constraints (TC). The identification of these qualitative constraints allowed quantitative bottlenecks to be detected. The research also showed that bottlenecks are associated with certain tasks performed in the software development environment within a given domain. In general, these tasks are consuming resources, such as effort, time and human resources. This fact leads to the software product to a low quality due to the lack of completeness and correctness of the artifacts delivered to the end of the productive process.",
692,5207,2017,Blending theories towards understanding and designing socio-technical scenarios,,2,,,,,,"To understand the interweaving of ubiquitous computer systems and their dynamic social relations different theoretical sources are necessary. Socially Aware Computing provides a deep understanding on how information systems emerge from and interact with the social context, whereas Actor-Network Theory represents a promising referential to explain how people and artifacts mutually actuate to render social structures. In this paper, we assess the paradigmatic compatibility of these two theories, proposing a blend, which provides a single basis to enrich the understanding of complex scenarios for designers of socially-aware technology, followed by an example of application in a real-world problem.",
693,5208,2017,Interaction Design in Free/Libre/Open Source Software Development: a systematic mapping,,2,,,,,,"Approaches for integrating interaction design into software development processes do not consider the specific development characteristics of free/libre/open source software (FLOSS). Researchers know the importance of integrating good practices of interaction design into the software development process. This paper aims to present a summary and analysis of methods, techniques, tools, strategies and approaches (MTTSA) to interaction design that have been proposed/used in the context of FLOSS development. A systematic mapping was performed to identify MTTSAs of interaction design proposed or used for/in the development of FLOSS. The results show that few studies have used MTTSA of interaction design in FLOSS context. No methods or techniques of interaction design proposed specifically for the development of FLOSS have found, and the majority of the selected papers do not present any type of validation through empirical studies. We hope that this paper provides an overview of studies that have used MTTSA of interaction design in FLOSS context, and becomes an initial effort to conduct new research proposals involving interaction design MTTSA and FLOSS development.",

For people with disabilities, however, that interaction becomes something more than simple: it becomes possible. The current work presents a proposal of an open-source, low cost universal remote control system that translates user's head poses into commands to electronic devices. In addition, a proximity sensor circuit was combined to radio-frequency modules in order to act as a wireless switch. Among the applications found with respect to alternative remote controls, none of them supports head gestures as input, which would certainly make them a viable option to people whose upper limbs are compromised. A mean opinion score questionnaire was applied to volunteers in order to evaluate the system. The results show great interest of the users in this kind of technology.",

Those mechanisms need to be carefully designed, but there are still no de facto standard design models to represent user-system interaction in a way that privileges decisions regarding the usability of the product being developed. Recently, we proposed USINN (USability-oriented INteraction and Navigation model) to express usability mechanisms in interaction and navigation modeling solutions. In this paper, we present an empirical study conducted in academic environment to investigate the use of USINN to represent usability mechanisms in interaction and navigation design solutions. The results indicated that the participants consider USINN to be easy to use and useful for the interaction and interface design. They also pointed out the need for a better knowledge about usability to apply USINN effectively.",

702,5217,2017,Design Ethnography for Screenless Interaction Style: hands-on and no-hands in early morning routines,,5,,,,,,"Possible digital technology futures are inevitably speculative, and tend to have present configurations as their points of reference. In this paper, we present the findings of design ethnography research which aims to create new understandings how screens are used in everyday routines, and the implications of this for the design of future screen interaction styles in everyday life contexts. We focus on the question of how hands are used in interactions with screens, why it is often impossible for hands to be used, and how users improvise to use screens without hands. To demonstrate this, we draw on examples of ethnographic research into everyday early morning routines where people deal with diverse materials, liquids, objects and surfaces as they prepare for the day ahead. Our findings show that mobile screen technology use and experience is inextricable from morning routines and shaped by the messiness and creative improvisations these routines involve. This, we argue, has implications for future technology design.",

707,5222,2017,UIFlex: a meta-design solution for the web,,2,,,,,,"To meet the diversity of users and the different interaction needs, user interfaces could be more flexible and adapted according to each user profile. The flexibility achieved by the interfaces of current web applications is scarce enough, preventing the power of meta-design. In addition, to adapt the web today the user has to configure each application separately and not all users are aware of the different possibilities of presentation and configuration of each of them. Thus, this article proposes a tool, named UIFlex, that assists the user in the construction of his/her interaction profile considering guidelines and good design recommendations. A set of rules is therefore defined and the tool adapts the presentation of different websites to each user. UIFlex was used by people with different interaction profiles and the results suggest improvements in the users' perceptions regarding satisfaction and efficiency.",

Traditional keyboard and mouse duet are replaced for new ways of input that use user's body as a means of interaction. However, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are still the major output when we analyze the form of display and feedback directed to the user. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink the design of the interaction when the devices used exploit other users' abilities in order to stimulate a better experience of using these devices when in conjunction with an IGU. In this context, the objective of this paper is to propose best practices for IGU projects that use interaction based on head movement tracking. We used the results of a Systematic Review of the Literature and a practical experiment trying to compare efficiency, effectiveness, user experience and interaction characteristics.",

There are several applications specific for autistic users to support their treatment. However, several works do not describe the process for choosing the interface elements to differentiate the specific aspects for such audience. These aspects are important, since an interface containing attractive elements for autistic people can provide a better interaction. This paper presents a study to identify the preferences of autistic children with regards to the interface components. The study was divided in two stages: (a) regarding the view of practitioners that deal directly with the children and with the presence of the researchers; and (b) with the presence of the practitioners, but without the presence of the researchers. This paper also presents the identified aspects, developing a collaborative repository to store recommendations that support the design of interfaces that are specific for autistic children.",

722,5237,2017,Here's What I Can Do: Chatbots' Strategies to Convey Their Features to Users,,4,,,,,,"Chatbots have been around since the 1960's, but recently they have risen in popularity especially due to new compatibility with social networks and messenger applications. Chatbots are different from traditional user interfaces, for they unveil themselves to the user one sentence at a time. Because of that, users may struggle to interact with them and to understand what they can do. Hence, it is important to support designers in deciding how to convey chatbots' features to users, as this might determine whether the user continues to chat or not. As a first step in this direction, in this paper our goal is to analyze the communicative strategies that have been used by popular chatbots to convey their features to users. To perform this analysis we use the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM). As a result we identify and discuss the different strategies used by the analyzed chatbots to present their features to users. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of using SIM on such interfaces.",
723,5238,2017,Designing for Pragmatists and Fundamentalists: Privacy Concerns and Attitudes on the Internet of Things,,5,,,,,,"Internet of Things (IoT) systems have aroused enthusiasm and concerns. Enthusiasm comes from their utilities in people daily life, and concerns may be associated with privacy issues. By using two IoT systems as case-studies, we examine users' privacy beliefs, concerns and attitudes. We focus on four major dimensions: the collection of personal data, the inference of new information, the exchange of information to third parties, and the risk-utility trade-off posed by the features of the system. Altogether, 113 Brazilian individuals answered a survey about such dimensions. Although their perceptions seem to be dependent on the context, there are recurrent patterns. Our results suggest that IoT users can be classified into unconcerned, fundamentalists and pragmatists. Most of them exhibit a pragmatist profile and believe in privacy as a right guaranteed by law. One of the most privacy concerning aspect is the exchange of personal information to third parties. Individuals' perceived risk is negatively correlated with their perceived utility in the features of the system. We discuss practical implications of these results and suggest heuristics to cope with privacy concerns when designing IoT systems.",

727,5242,2017,How Much Effort is Necessary for Blind Users to Read Web-based Mathematical Formulae?: A comparison using task models with different screen readers,,5,,,,,,"Providing access to mathematical content on websites for blind users who use screen readers has been an important challenge for accessibility in Human-Computer Interaction. Further to limitations in reading content in languages such as Brazilian Portuguese, there are many issues related to the effort demanded from blind users to navigate within mathematical formulae when solving problems to reach for specific information. In this paper, we performed estimations of the effort required by blind users to navigate within mathematical formulae using task models with GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) and KLM (Keystroke-Level Model). We analyzed task models for different mathematical formulae using available navigation resources in the screen readers JAWS (Job Access With Speech), ChromeVox and NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access), considering the optimal paths that could be used by experienced blind users. The results showed that JAWS currently provides more detailed navigation resources that allow for faster and more precise navigation than ChromeVox and NVDA. However, we observed that there are important issues regarding the complexity of the interactions required to use those navigation resources. This could be very challenging for blind users when performing mathematical problem solving tasks, which are cognitively-demanding themselves. The investigation of new enhanced interaction approaches for within-formulae navigation in screen readers is very important to make mathematical learning and problem solving on the Web easier for blind users.",

730,5245,2017,Using Information Visualization to comprehend user interface layer: an application to web-based systems,,3,,,,,,"Web applications have a complex user interface (UI) structure. The lack of formal documentation for web applications has been noticed in literature. If updated, formal documentation (and its models) would be helpful both to development and maintenance tasks. However, UI models are difficult to understand because they must have all information about UI structure, with levels of abstraction and scattered information across multiple diagrams. We propose an UI presentation using Information Visualization techniques, named ModelUIVIZ, to support understanding UI implementation. For that, we implemented two tools: a reverse engineering tool, named WebModelUI Data, to extract data from web applications; and the WebModelUI Tool, to create visual presentations. In order to evaluate ModelUIVIZ, we also conducted a controlled experiment focusing on evaluating the ModelUIVIZ on supporting UI comprehension, what had positive results. In this paper we present both the ModelUIVIZ, its evaluation as well as results obtained.",

Although SPIDe may include cultural aspects of interaction design, other aspects should be considered, such as different skills and disabilities. This paper presents partial results of SPIDe adaptation to include visually impaired users in a semio-participatory interaction design process using action-research as research method. Adjustments in the contextual analysis stage of SPIDe were recommended, including the Storytelling technique, enabling visually impaired people to participate as coauthor in interaction design process.",
751,5266,2017,The Acceptability of Digital Immortality: Today's Human is Tomorrow's Avatar,,2,,,,,,"Technological development now enables digital immortality, especially through post-mortem digital memorials, chatbots and avatars. By managing users' digital legacy, digital lives can be recreated. In this article, we discuss preliminary results from researches about digital immortality, focusing on current discussions in the context of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. We aim at understanding the acceptance of digital immortality among our research participants. The data were collected in a focus group, with participants from different areas. The discussion was fomented by the presentation of video snippets. This qualitative research analyzes these data and proposes research questions in this area.",
752,5267,2017,Automatic SignWriting Generation of Libras Signs from CORE-SL,,3,,,,,,"It can be argued that the lack of access to information and knowledge in their natural language is one of the obstacles faced by Deaf Communities around the world. Providing access to communication, information and knowledge for the Deaf are just some of the motivations for writing record in Brazilian Sign Language (Libras). SignWriting is the most used writing system in sign languages, because it is complete, with the power to graphically represent any of them. However, this expressive power implies a great complexity that has not yet been computationally solved. This paper describes a research project of an automatic generator of Libras signs in SignWriting as an alternative to this problem, together with its results so far.",
753,5268,2017,Tangible Interfaces: An Analysis of User Experience Using the AR Sandbox Project,,5,,,,,,"The desire to make the human-computer interaction more natural, and the limitation between real and virtual became practically imperceptible, resulted in the development of Tangible Interfaces (TUI). In TUI physical objects are interpreted by the system as digital information. Therefore, users interact with the system through the manipulation of physical objects, the system recognizes the actions and responds through the digital projection. The AR Sandbox is a Tangible Interface application that allows the user to view and shape topographic maps. This work presents a reference for the development of tangible interfaces applications, since TUI applications are recent and there are no specific methodologies to evaluate this type of interface. For this purpose, a partnership was made with the Hydric Engineering course to implement the AR Sandbox for didactic and research purposes, and for this work uses it as tangible interface study material. In this work the interaction with AR Sandbox is evaluated in order to extract guidelines useful for development of TUIs.",

For the company, usability, accessibility and affectibility form three pillars that should be part of any development process of technologies. The purpose of this article is to characterize the developed works by CPqD usability team in recent years, highlighting the solutions that the company proposed in response to several research problems that have been presented.",
755,5270,2017,Bottester: Testing Conversational Systems with Simulated Users,,4,,,,,,"Recently, conversation agents have attracted the attention of many companies such as IBM, Facebook, Google, and Amazon which have focused on developing tools or API (Application Programming Interfaces) for developers to create their own chat-bots. In this paper, we focus on new approaches to evaluate such systems presenting some recommendations resulted from evaluating a real chatbot use case. Testing conversational agents or chatbots is not a trivial task due to the multitude aspects/tasks (e.g., natural language understanding, dialog management and, response generation) which must be considered separately and as a mixture. Also, the creation of a general testing tool is a challenge since evaluation is very sensitive to the application context. Finally, exhaustive testing can be a tedious task for the project team what creates a need for a tool to perform it automatically. This paper opens a discussion about how conversational systems testing tools are essential to ensure well-functioning of such systems as well as to help interface designers guiding them to develop consistent conversational interfaces.",
756,5271,2017,A Comparative Study of Technology-Mediated Learning Strategies for Teaching People with Intellectual Disability,,3,,,,,,"In this paper, we report on our experiences investigating the role of digital technology in face-to-face instruction of students with intellectual disability. In this process, we used a multi-method approach and our findings integrate results from focus groups, interviews, observations, iterative prototyping, and user evaluation. Ultimately, we hope that our work can motivate future research efforts and bring to light opportunities to be considered in the development of mobile-based education solutions.",
